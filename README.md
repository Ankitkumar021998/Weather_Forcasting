This Weather Forecasting App is a real-time web application that allows users to check current weather conditions for any city worldwide. It fetches live weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather description, and dynamic weather icons in a clean and modern user interface. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a responsive glassmorphism design, instant search with Enter key support, and smooth loading feedback for a better user experience. This project demonstrates API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch/async-await), and frontend development skills.
